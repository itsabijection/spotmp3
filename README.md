# Caveats
1. There is no guarantee that this will continue working for any length of time. It is built on top of relatively fragile components, and is not made to be particularly robust.
2. The code will only download the first 99 songs in a playlist. I suggest making multiple playlists of 99 if you really want to download more than that.
3. The names of the downloaded files are semi-random - they don't necessarily match the official song title. Also they start with 2 letters each so that if you alphabetize the folder they are in it will be in the same order as your playlist. This may be a feature of an annoyance depending on your perspective.
4. The program won't always get the right songs - I suggest checking the first couple seconds of each one.
5. Don't use this illegally
